# Penguins-app

In this repository, I use Heroku to deploy an app built on streamlit. The app predicts Palmer penguin species given some input parameters.

The data used as input parameters could be inputed manually or a csv file containing all the Palmer penguins attributes could be uploaded. The output for an uploaded csv file is a DataFrame Series object where each row signifies the prediction for the corresponding row in the input csv file.

The deployed web app is live at https://st-penguins-app.herokuapp.com/
